# Telegram Channel Blocker Bot

Channel go away!

---

This bot is used to delete and ban message sent by channel

# How this appears?

The reason this appears please see this [contest](https://core.telegram.org/contest/android-2021-11-api) hosted by Telegram

```
channels.sendAsPeers peers:Vector<Peer> chats:Vector<Chat> users:Vector<User> = channels.SendAsPeers;

...

---functions---

...

channels.getSendAs peer:InputPeer = channels.SendAsPeers;
```

In the contest, Telegram added few new APIs. One of them is `channels.sendAsPeers`.
\
This API can send message as a channel peer.

This changes applied in both Development and Production server,
\
but in Production this behaves were limited. (Only channel admin can send as a channel peer)

Later (07-12-2021), Telegram released a new update that normal user can do the same thing, as they are owner of the channel peer.
\
So this bot is invented to solve this problem.

Currently, (07-12-2021) Telegram didn't add those APIs in the official Schema.
